//
//  LeaderboardStandingCache.swift
//  Tailspot
//
//  Device-local cache of the SERVER-truth leaderboard facts that trophies
//  read: weekly/monthly champion win counts and the ever-held-#1-all-time flag.
//  Both are computed exclusively by the backend (Monday crowning /
//  `alltime_toppers` ledger) and reach the device only inside a
//  GET /v1/leaderboard `me` payload — the app must NEVER infer a win
//  locally (a device can't know it held #1 at the closing bell).
//
//  Writes happen in the SCREENS' fetch completions (ProfileScreen's
//  `loadStanding`, LeaderboardScreen's `load`) via `update(from:)` — a
//  deliberate choice over hooking the client's decode path, so the network
//  layer stays side-effect free and every cache write is visible at the
//  call site.
//
//  Reads feed `TrophyProgressInputs` (Top Flight / Dynasty / Chart Topper)
//  and ProfileScreen's WEEKLY/MONTHLY CHAMPION laurels (their @AppStorage
//  values observe the same win-count keys, so a write refreshes them live).
//  Offline degradation falls out of the storage: the last-fetched values
//  persist across launches, and a fresh install that has never reached the
//  backend reads 0 / false — all three trophies locked.
//
//  Same shape as `TrophyEventStore`: a concrete `nonisolated` struct over
//  UserDefaults (thread-safe accessors); tests inject an isolated
//  `UserDefaults(suiteName:)`.
//
